          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello viewers! My name is Ismah Sengendo. I'm a junior in highschool,
            and this is my first year doing web design. I've had experience
            with softwares like Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe In-design 
            but, understanding the foundation of these softwares--coding--is a very cool 
            skill to learn and grow with.

    <p>The purpose of this project is to create an 8-page “Choose Your Own Adventure” website that demonstrates my understanding of HTML structure, navigation, and storytelling. The objective is to use correct file organization and include required elements such as paragraph tags, headings, inline formatting tags, at least one image, and a properly formatted list. The site must be coherent, entertaining, easy to navigate, logically organized, and the code should be clean and commented where ideas or code were borrowed.</p>
