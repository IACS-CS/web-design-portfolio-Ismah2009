          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello viewers! My name is Ismah Sengendo. I'm a junior in highschool,
            and this is my first year doing web design. I've had experience
            with softwares like Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe In-design 
            but, understanding the foundation of these softwares--coding--is a very cool 
            skill to learn and grow with.

">Choose-Your-Own Adventure Project Link</a>
        </p>
    <p>The purpose of this project is to create an 8-page “Choose Your Own Adventure” website that demonstrates my understanding of HTML structure, navigation, and storytelling. The objective is to use correct file organization and include required elements such as paragraph tags, headings, inline formatting tags, at least one image, and a properly formatted list. The site must be coherent, entertaining, easy to navigate, logically organized, and the code should be clean and commented where ideas or code were borrowed.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate mastery of fundamental CSS layout techniques by creating two distinct business cards. One using only Box Model properties and the other using Flexbox; while also applying key design principles such as Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity.</p>

        <h2>Sources &amp; Attribution</h2>
        <p>
          Fix me... you can add a list of sources you used to create your
          portfolio here. Be sure to acknowledge any images, fonts, or other
          media you used that you did not create yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, remember if you use AI to help (including Copilot), you
          must acknowledge it here with a description of how you used AI &mdash;
          you can list tasks AI helped you with, and you should also include
          notes <em>in your source code</em> describing any AI-generated code.
