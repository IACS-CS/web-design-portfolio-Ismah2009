          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello viewers! My name is Ismah Sengendo. I'm a junior in highschool,
            and this is my first year doing web design. I've had experience
            with softwares like Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe In-design 
            but, understanding the foundation of these softwares--coding--is a very cool 
            skill to learn and grow with. This is probobly the first time you've 
            seen a portfolio with the color palette of lime, gold, and black! It's just sooo me.

        </p>
    <p>The purpose of this project is to create an 8-page “Choose Your Own Adventure” website that demonstrates my understanding of HTML structure, navigation, and storytelling. The objective is to use correct file organization and include required elements such as paragraph tags, headings, inline formatting tags, at least one image, and a properly formatted list. The site must be coherent, entertaining, easy to navigate, logically organized, and the code should be clean and commented where ideas or code were borrowed.</p>

</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the power and flexibility of CSS by transforming a fixed HTML structure into a visually unique and engaging design using only a custom stylesheet. This project highlights my ability to apply advanced CSS techniques; such as layout systems, typography, color theory, and responsiveness; while following core design principles including Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity. Multiple designs showcase different layout approaches and creative experimentation, emphasizing how CSS alone can significantly change the look and feel of a webpage.</p>

        <h2>Sources &amp; Attribution</h2>
        <p>
          Fix me... you can add a list of sources you used to create your
          portfolio here. Be sure to acknowledge any images, fonts, or other
          media you used that you did not create yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, remember if you use AI to help (including Copilot), you
          must acknowledge it here with a description of how you used AI &mdash;
          you can list tasks AI helped you with, and you should also include
          notes <em>in your source code</em> describing any AI-generated code.
